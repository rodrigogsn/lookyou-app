# Lookyou App

Gather all clothes from your wardrobe and let Lookyou generate the best looks for you. This 
app has the ability to associate your personal lifestyle to the clothes that best suits you. Make the most out of your clothes, and never repeat a look again.

## How does it work?

The user uploads pictures of theis own clothes, and catalog them with predefined values of color, type, prints and more. Lookyou has a built-in system with **chromatic analysis**, which allows it to suggest color matching looks for the current clothes uploaded.

The app also presents an calendar that allows the user to set dates to when each look will be used, and also highlight if its for day or night events.  

## Technologies behind it

Ionic 4, React, Firebase, AdonisJS, MySQL.
Lookyou Backend on GitHUb: https://github.com/rodrigogsn/lookyou-backend/

## Next steps

The next big task is to let the app reads the clothes pictures (OCR) and automatically categorize them by color and type.
